## Overview  
Welcome to my **Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard Project**!  
This data analytics project focuses on cleaning, pre-processing, analyzing, and visualizing coffee shop sales data using **MS Excel**. The primary goal is to build a dynamic dashboard that provides key business insights into customer behavior, sales performance, and product demand, enabling better decision-making.

## Project Description  
Sales data analysis is critical for identifying trends, improving customer experience, and maximizing revenue. In this project, I utilized **Excel pivot tables, charts, and slicers** to transform raw sales data into an interactive and visually appealing dashboard.  

The dashboard highlights important KPIs such as:  
- Total Sales  
- Total Footfall  
- Average Bill per Person  
- Average Order per Person  

It also provides deeper insights into:  
- Sales by product categories  
- Sales performance across store locations  
- Top-selling products  
- Order patterns based on hours and weekdays  
- Size distribution of orders
